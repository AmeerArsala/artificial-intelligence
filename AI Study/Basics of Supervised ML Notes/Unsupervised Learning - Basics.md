# Unsupervised Learning
Finds something interesting (e.g. a structure or pattern) in unlabeled data. 
- Not given the "right answers" like supervised learning
- We ask the algorithm to find structure in the data
- Data comes with inputs x but not output labels y -> Algorithm must find structure in the data

## Clustering
Separate data into multiple different types of clusters; groups them together into categories. NOT like classification where the correct answers are already shown and the categories are already defined.

In the example below, we ask the algorithm "what are the different types of people by their genes?"

## Anomaly Detection
Find unusual data points/events

Examples of applications:
- Flaw Detection in the financial system: unusual transactions can be signs of fraud

## Dimensionality Reduction
Take a larger dataset and compress it using fewer numbers
