KICK START YOUR GRAPH ML JOURNEY WITH THIS RESOURCES

One of the really cool topics to study is Graph Machine Learning, these days. So here are some bunch of FREE resources that can help to kickstart the Graph ML journey.

## Theory (Videos)
1.  If you just want some good intuition about how Graph NN works with less maths, check out this playlist : [PLAYLIST](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV8yxwGOxvvoNkzPfCx2i8an--Tkt7O8Z). First just go through the first 6 videos and it will give you some good understanding of this thing. 

2.  Once done now you can now see this 1 hr video by Microsoft, its really cool and makes Graph ML understanding real fun and easy. [VIDEO LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCEYiCxrL_0)
   
3.  Now you can invest your time to some greater extent with these series of videos provided by Stanford. The one and only [CS224W course.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAB_plj2rbA&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn) This course is very long and will take a lot of time. But it's worth watching.

4.  Here comes another playlist and it deals with natural entities like geodesics, manifolds, mesh structures as Graphs. This is really exciting and this subfield is also called Geometric Deep Learning. Legendary Graph ML researchers Michael Bronstein (Imperial College/Twitter)  Joan Bruna (NYU)  Taco Cohen (Qualcomm) and Petar Veličković (DeepMind) are the instructors.  [PLAYLIST LINK](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn2-dEmQeTfQ8YVuHBOvAhUlnIPYxkeu3)

5.  Want to understand Graph ML by reading paper walkthroughs ? Check out this amazing playlist by Aleksa Gordić, (DeepMind). [PLAYLIST LINK.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBoQnSflObckArGNhOcNg7lQG_f0ZlHF5)

## Theory (Books)
Yes, There are few but some great books to get started with Graph Machine Learning. Here is a list of the books.

1.  [BOOK LINK](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-PyTorch-Scikit-Learn-learning/dp/1801819319/ref=asc_df_1801819319/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=586338225290&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4758050285249186775&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9298466&hvtargid=pla-1763569602912&psc=1). This book deals with general PyTorch concepts but it has a chapter of Graph ML which is really great and worth giving a shot.

2.  [BOOK LINK](https://www.amazon.com/Graph-Neural-Networks-Foundations-Applications/dp/9811660530). This book is more like collections of different papers summarized and elaborated in a really good manner. This book contains all the topics from start till end related to Graph Machine Learning and all its variations along with lots of maths. 

3.  [BOOK LINK](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/). This is also a famous book related to representation learning and theory behind representation learning and Graph ML. It also covers some graph theories too. This book is small but is a bit advanced. So not recommended for beginners. 

4.  [BOOK LINK](https://www.amazon.com/Graph-Machine-Learning-techniques-algorithms/dp/1800204493). A more practical approach towards Graph ML and hands-on projects. The primary libraries used here are Networkx, TensorFlow. 

## Practical Application and Resources with more Hands-on projects
Here are some more resources of blogs and youtube links that provide a more hands on approach. 
1.  [PLAYLIST LINK](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGMXrbDNfqTzqxB1IGgimuhtfAhGd8lHF). This playlist provides a great hands on learning with PyTorch Geometric. 

2.  [PLAYLIST LINK](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV8yxwGOxvvoNkzPfCx2i8an--Tkt7O8Z), Same as the very first link, this youtube playlist is a gem for Graph ML. Framework: PyTorch Geometric.

3.  [VIDEO LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8owQBFAHw7E). A cool hands-on tutorial by one and only Petar Veličković. Framework: TensorFlow.

4.  BLOG LINK [(part 1)](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/a-beginners-guide-to-graph-neural-networks-using-pytorch-geometric-part-1-d98dc93e7742), [(part 2)](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-graph-neural-networks-using-pytorch-geometric-part-2-cd82c01330ab). This is also a great resource to start and learn Graph ML and PyTorch geometric.
